The Habitual Rise
=================

I die whenever faced with the blank page.
It comes in torrents, or not at all.
Titles like "Manifesto" or "Executive
Summary." When I'm holding Infinity in
one hand, shall I shuck an oyster with
the other?

When taking lessons from the School of
Life. Knee deep in contemplation at
the College of Experience. We all come
to an inevitable conclusion:

"Am I making a difference?"

Consider the typical work day.

And all the gigabytes of data consumed.

Will any of it be relevant at the 
final tally. Or is it just chaff to be
scattered by the four winds?

Whither _ecstasy_?
